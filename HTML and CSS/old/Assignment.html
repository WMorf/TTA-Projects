			<p><h3>These are my thoughts on currency scaling in Table Top Roleplaying Games.</h3></p>
			
			<blockquote cite="https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Coinage">
			Coinage refers to the metal pieces often found by adventurers as treasure and used 
			to purchase goods and services. The standard currency in most worlds of Dungeons & Dragons 
			is the gold piece (abbreviated gp), although platinum, silver, copper, and coinage of other 
			materials are also found as treasure.

		<h6>Copper</h6>
		<p><em>The penny of the fantasy world.</em></p>
		
		<h5>Silver</h5>
		<p>Much more shiny. Basically a token for a good meal. Worth 10 Copper coins.</p>
		
		<h4>Electrum</h4>
		<p>Electrum is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, 
		with trace amounts of copper and other metals. Worth 5 Silver coins. </p>
		
		<h3>Gold</h3>
		<p>Shiny,shimmering splendor. Once you start throwing these around, 
		you'll forget what copper looks like. Worth 10 Silver coins. </p>
		
		<h1>Platinum</h1>
		<p>Cause you always have to go one extra. Strange this is on the top when
		electrum contains trace amounts of platinum typically. Ah well. Worth 10
		Gold coins.</p>
